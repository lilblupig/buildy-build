Comment code always!

Validation - fields number required!  Shaun could make letters!

Server side validation:

if bricks_wanted ==  etc

is_numeric (! not numeric return 0)

Could redirect to home page - header redirect
Could say no

Does POST exist? if $_POST

Can call variables into fields for continuity


Fun With Functions:

Function code which can be executed with a single call
Used to prevent repetition

Buildy Build order does not matter!
Good to keep functions together

function name(parameters) {}
Can only return a single thing - use arrays
If parameters given, must pass values!

Force Global if necessary but not good idea

Private and public functions


Include Files

include (errors but continues) or require (ends page)

Joins pages together as one page!
